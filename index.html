	<h1>Lab 03</h1>
	<p>Create a JavaScript function that permits the creation of a hamburger object. Consider that a hamburger has many options 
		 that might include: different types of buns,
			vegetable garnishes, 
			assortments of cheeses, 
			specialty sauces, 
			different meat patties(beef, chicken, vegetarian), 
			single, double, or triple patty, 
			Pickles, hot peppers, olives etc.
		Add some extra if you want, and make sure that the function allows for the output of a sentence that describes the hamburger, too</p>
	<p>My JavaScript code created two Hamburger objects: burger1 and burger2.</p>	
	<p>Just type burger1.printBurger() or burger2.printBurger() on the console and press Enter:</p>	
	<p id="output"></p>
